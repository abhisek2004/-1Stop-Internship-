   Building a clone of the 1Stop Intern company website is an excellent way to showcase your front-end development skills. This project likely involved creating a visually appealing and responsive single-page website that mirrors the design and functionality of the original site. You may have utilized HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. By successfully replicating the company's website, you demonstrate your ability to translate design concepts into fully functional web pages. 🌐💼

2. **Calculator**:
   Developing a calculator is a classic project in web development that helps solidify your understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Your calculator project likely involved designing a user interface with buttons for digits and operators, implementing logic to perform arithmetic operations, and displaying results dynamically. This project demonstrates your proficiency in JavaScript programming and your ability to create interactive web applications. ➕➖✖️➗
